## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox layout
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive images using `<picture>` element
- Media queries for adaptive design

### Accessibility

- Proper semantic structure using `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<h1>`–`<h2>` hierarchy
- ARIA labels for interactive elements like buttons
- Meaningful alt text for images
- Focus and hover states for keyboard and pointer users
- Color contrast optimized for readability

### What I Learned

- How to create a fully responsive layout using Flexbox and media queries.
- Managing image responsiveness with the `<picture>` element and `object-fit`.
- Using CSS custom properties for consistent color schemes and typography.
- Structuring semantic HTML for accessibility.

### Continued Development

Add JavaScript interactivity, e.g., quantity selection and dynamic cart updates.
